# Developer documentation

AviQtl-Plus combines a C++23 and Qt 6 application core with Qt Quick UI, QRhi
rendering, ECS-oriented timeline data, FFmpeg media processing, LuaJIT plugins,
and QML/GLSL effect packages.

## Start contributing

1. Read [Build from source](./building).
2. Review the main repository's
   [contribution guide](https://github.com/GT-610/AviQtl-Plus/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md).
3. Run the relevant automated tests before and after a change.
4. Update user documentation when behavior or interface labels change.

## Extension paths

- [Effects and objects](./effects): package JSON metadata, QML integration, and
  fragment or compute shaders.
- [Plugin development](./plugins): LuaJIT automation, lifecycle hooks,
  permissions, and package distribution.
- Native application development: C++, Qt Quick, timeline services, media
  decoding, rendering, audio, and tests in the main repository.

## Product targets and workflows

- [AviUtl operability targets](./operability-targets): the editing-model
  compatibility goals that guide development.
- [Timeline edit target rules](./timeline-edit-targets): where timeline commands
  act.
- [Release checklist](./release-checklist): requirements for a valid release.

User workflows remain in the [user guide](/guide/start-here/) so API and architecture
details do not interrupt task-oriented instructions.
