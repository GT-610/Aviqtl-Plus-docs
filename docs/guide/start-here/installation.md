# Install AviQtl-Plus

## Download a release

Download a build for your platform from the
[AviQtl-Plus releases page](https://github.com/GT-610/AviQtl-Plus/releases).
Extract the archive to a folder you can write to, then start the AviQtl-Plus
executable.

Choose the archive that matches your operating system and architecture.

## Platform notes

### Windows

Use a current 64-bit Windows system. If Windows displays a security prompt,
confirm that the archive came from the official release page before allowing it
to run.

### Linux

Linux builds require a current Qt 6, FFmpeg, LuaJIT, a Vulkan implementation,
Carla, and Clang/libc++. An Arch Linux-equivalent environment is the primary
target. On older distributions, using an Arch container through Distrobox is
recommended.

You may need to grant execute permission after extracting the archive:

```bash
chmod +x AviQtl
./AviQtl
```

We're also planning platform-specific packages and AppImage release. These will be shipped in the future.

### macOS

Open the application bundle from Finder. If macOS blocks the first launch,
review the application in **System Settings → Privacy & Security** and allow it
only when it was downloaded from the official release.

## First launch checklist

- The preview window opens without a graphics initialization error.
- The timeline and settings windows can be shown from the application menus.
- Audio and video files can be selected from a local folder.

If startup fails, see [Troubleshooting](../help-and-reference/troubleshooting). 

## Install from source code
